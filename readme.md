**HIX** is a lightweight, versatile web server built to fit the way you work. Whether you're 
after total freedom or a structured, rock-solid architecture, HIX gives you the tools you need 
to build modern apps efficiently.

## ⚙️ Two philosophies, one engine

**HIX** is designed to let you code in two different ways:

* **HIX Style:** "The playbook" A predefined, optimized app structure 
that follows industry best practices, so you can scale and maintain your code without the headache.

* **Standard:** For coders who go their own way no trends, no set patterns, 
just pure freedom.



**HIX Style** is all about helping developers get on the same page. By using HIX Style, 
sharing code, contributing to other projects, and building scalable solutions becomes second nature 
no more friction from learning a new structure with every repo. The main goal here is to offer a 
common path that works for everyone.

## ✔️ Last Audited Version

**HIX v2.2 - Audit Edition**

HIX reaches version 2.2 with a complete security audit behind it: 87 points reviewed, 
87 closed, 2105 tests passing on Windows and Linux.

The classic vectors were audited and fixed - path traversal, cookie injection, timing 
attacks on JWT, mutex races, misconfigured CORS, IPv6 bypass in the firewall - and 
everything else that can cause harm in a real environment under load.

The result is a **Harbour server ready for production**: robust, secure, and validated.
